# Summary

The modern AI development landscape has evolved from monolithic, siloed tools in 2024 to a modular three-layer architecture in 2025. This fundamental shift represents a move from vendor lock-in to composable, interoperable systems that give developers unprecedented control and flexibility.

The three-layer stack separates concerns into distinct components: **Layer 1 (Frontier Models)** provides the intelligence through large language models like GPT-5, Claude Opus 4, and Gemini 2.5 Pro. These models handle reasoning, code generation, and understanding. **Layer 2 (AI-First IDEs)** serves as the workspace where developers write code and interact with AI through environments like VS Code, Cursor, and Windsurf. **Layer 3 (Development Agents)** handles autonomous orchestration of complex, multi-step tasks through tools like Claude Code CLI, Aider, and Devin.

The key innovation making this possible is the Model Context Protocol (MCP), which acts like USB for AI tools—providing a standardized way for different components to communicate. This eliminates the proprietary integrations that created vendor lock-in in 2024.

The shift enables developers to compose best-of-breed tools at each layer. Want Claude's reasoning in Cursor with Aider for execution? Done. Need to switch to a new model when it launches? Change one configuration setting. This modularity means specific tools may change, but the architectural pattern remains durable.

When selecting your stack, consider: frontier model choice (performance vs. cost vs. privacy), IDE preference (existing skills vs. AI-native experience), and agent autonomy level (supervised vs. autonomous execution). The architecture itself is the lasting knowledge—understanding why separating models from interfaces from agents matters transfers even as individual tools evolve.

## Key Concepts

- Three-layer AI development stack: Frontier Models (intelligence), AI-First IDEs (workspace), Development Agents (orchestration)
- Model Context Protocol (MCP) as the standardization layer enabling interoperability
- Evolution from 2024's monolithic tool silos to 2025's composable architecture
- Independent layer selection allows mixing best-of-breed tools without vendor lock-in
- Architectural patterns are durable while specific tool implementations remain volatile
