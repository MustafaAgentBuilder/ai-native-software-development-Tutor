# Summary

This lesson explores the fundamental paradigm shift from User Interface (navigation-based interaction) to User Intent (conversation-based orchestration), demonstrating how AI agents transform software interaction patterns. The traditional model requires users to navigate explicit interfaces through 14 manual steps to book a hotel—knowing where to click, what to select, and how to navigate prescribed workflows. The agentic model reduces this to 3 conversational exchanges where users state intent ("I need a hotel in Chicago next Tuesday") and agents orchestrate autonomous execution, including remembering preferences, inferring needs (scheduling Uber without being asked), and integrating with calendars automatically.

The transformation becomes possible through five fundamental AI capabilities working in combination: See (visual understanding of screenshots, documents, diagrams), Hear (audio processing and natural speech understanding), Reason (complex decision-making and multi-step logic), Act (API calls and cross-system orchestration), and Remember (context maintenance and preference learning). The hotel booking example demonstrates all five powers in sequence—hearing the request, reasoning about requirements, remembering quiet room preferences, acting to search and book, seeing hotel websites and maps, reasoning to evaluate options, acting to schedule transportation, and remembering the interaction for future improvements.

The skill shift for developers is profound: interface-era priorities (UI/UX design, frontend frameworks, form validation, CSS, click-through testing) give way to intent-era capabilities (intent modeling from natural language, context management with memory and personalization, agent orchestration for multi-step workflows, specification writing with clear testable descriptions, and evaluation design for testing understanding). Specifications evolve from "when user clicks button X, do Y" to "when user expresses intent Z in any phrasing, agent understands and acts appropriately."

The evolution through three phases contextualizes this shift: Predictive AI could only forecast from historical data, Generative AI creates content when prompted, and Agentic AI takes autonomous action to achieve goals—shifting from tool to teammate, from responding to orchestrating. Understanding the Five Powers isn't just academic—it transforms specification writing, as developers who know AI can "see" diagrams will include visual specs, and those who know it "remembers" context will build on previous conversations.

## Key Concepts

- Paradigm shift: User Interface (navigation, manual initiation, prescribed workflows) to User Intent (conversation, autonomous agents, adaptive workflows)
- Five Powers enabling orchestration: See (visual), Hear (audio), Reason (decisions), Act (execute), Remember (context)—combined they enable autonomous multi-step workflows
- Development skill evolution: from UI/UX design and frontend frameworks to intent modeling, context management, and agent orchestration
- AI phase progression: Predictive (analyze data) → Generative (create content) → Agentic (autonomous action and orchestration)
- Specification transformation: from explicit interface instructions to intent understanding across varying natural language phrasings
