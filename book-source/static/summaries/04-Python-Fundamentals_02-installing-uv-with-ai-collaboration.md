# Summary

Installing UV is a straightforward process that demonstrates the strategic use of AI in development workflows. The lesson teaches platform-specific installation commands for macOS, Linux, and Windows, emphasizing that simple deterministic tasks should use direct commands rather than AI assistance. Installation takes under one minute via official scripts from astral.sh that automatically configure PATH environment variables. The critical concept introduced is the PATH registry—a computer's directory list for locating executable commands. Students verify installation success by running `uv --version` in a fresh terminal session. The lesson establishes an important pattern: use direct commands for simple tasks, reserve AI collaboration for troubleshooting and complex problems. When errors occur (command not found, permission denied, network issues), AI becomes valuable for diagnosing platform-specific issues and providing context-aware fixes. This strategic approach prevents over-engineering simple processes while leveraging AI's strength in handling ambiguous, complex troubleshooting scenarios. The lesson reinforces that AI-driven development means using AI when it adds value, not for every task indiscriminately.

## Key Concepts

- Simple deterministic installation tasks require direct platform-specific commands, not AI assistance
- PATH environment variable functions as the computer's command registry, enabling system-wide access to installed tools
- Installation verification requires closing and reopening terminal to refresh PATH configuration
- AI collaboration becomes valuable for troubleshooting errors rather than executing straightforward installation steps
- Strategic AI usage pattern: direct commands for simple tasks, AI for complex diagnosis and platform-specific problem-solving
