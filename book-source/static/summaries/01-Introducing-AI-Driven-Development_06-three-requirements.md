# Summary

Vertical market success requires all three non-negotiable elements working in perfect sync: domain expertise, deep integrations, and complete agentic solutions. Missing any one element causes failure. Requirement 1 (Domain Expertise) has two viable paths: Path 1 fine-tunes underlying AI models on domain-specific data (expensive, powerful, deep pattern recognition) or Path 2 builds vertical reusable intelligence through specialized sub-agents and agent skills (faster iteration, transparent, procedural expertise). Both paths defensible—competitors must replicate months of development.

Path 1 (Fine-Tuning) excels when you have large domain datasets, need subtle pattern recognition (medical diagnosis from imaging, legal document analysis), require natural expert-sounding language, and have budget for retraining. Path 2 (Vertical Intelligence) excels when domain expertise is procedural (insurance claim routing, compliance checking), you need fast iteration as a startup, fine-tuning data is limited or expensive, and domain has clear rules to follow. Many successful companies use both: fine-tune for domain language understanding, layer vertical intelligence (sub-agents, skills, MCPs) for specific workflows.

Requirement 2 (Deep Integrations) demands speaking incumbent systems' languages—not just reading data but writing back respecting workflows, security models, and approval processes. Healthcare subagents reading Epic but unable to write clinical notes in correct format are useless. These integrations are expensive (months of API documentation, regulatory compliance, security audits) and defensible (competitors must rebuild).

Requirement 3 (Complete Agentic Solutions) solves end-to-end problems, not slices. Healthcare subagents must read EHR, clinical literature, insurance rules, and FDA regulations, then recommend immediately actionable treatment plans—coordinating all five components (system prompt, horizontal skills, vertical skills, horizontal MCPs, vertical MCPs) into customer-sensible workflows. OpenAI's Study Mode failed by having partial requirements without complete integration, remaining a feature rather than transformative product.

## Key Concepts

- All three requirements mandatory: domain expertise (via fine-tuning OR vertical intelligence), deep integrations, complete agentic solutions
- Two paths to domain expertise: Path 1 (fine-tuned models for pattern recognition) or Path 2 (vertical intelligence for procedural workflows)
- Deep integrations (reading and writing to incumbent systems) are expensive and defensible competitive moats
- Complete agentic solutions coordinate five components solving end-to-end problems, not partial slices
- Missing any single requirement creates bottlenecks; partial solutions remain features, not products
