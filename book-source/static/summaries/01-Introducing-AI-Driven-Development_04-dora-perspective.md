# Summary

This lesson reveals Google Cloud's DORA 2025 research finding that AI doesn't fix broken processes but amplifies them—same tool producing opposite outcomes depending on organizational foundation. Organization A with strong practices deployed 35% faster with unchanged 2.8% failure rate and higher developer satisfaction, while Organization B deployed 40% faster but saw failure rate climb from 6% to 14% with developer burnout from firefighting. The amplifier metaphor is perfect: DORA shows AI doesn't change organizational capability, it multiplies it—strong testing practices (80% coverage, fast CI/CD) maintain quality at 2x speed, while weak testing (manual QA, slow deploys) ship untested code 2x faster.

The seven DORA capabilities that determine AI success are: Clear AI Stance (documented policies enabling confident use without guesswork), Healthy Data Ecosystem (documented schemas and versioning preventing AI-generated code minefields), AI-Accessible Internal Data (structured documentation and up-to-date READMEs multiplying AI value), Strong Version Control (Git-based PRs providing safety net for high-volume changes), Working in Small Batches (frequent focused changes keeping AI-accelerated pace reviewable and safe), User-Centric Focus (ensuring velocity translates to value not just features shipped), and Quality Internal Platform (reliable CI/CD capturing full AI velocity benefit without deployment bottlenecks).

The guardrails-enable-speed principle emerges from mountain road analogy: roads with cliff-edge guardrails allow faster driving than roads without because guardrails provide confidence. In software, automated tests, code review, CI/CD pipelines, and monitoring aren't obstacles—they're safety systems enabling bold experimentation. DORA data shows organizations with strong guardrails see 20-30% productivity gains from AI, while those without see initial velocity spikes followed by stability degradation resulting in net-negative value.

The skeptic's question—whether improving AI models eliminate the need for these capabilities—is addressed directly: even with GPT-5 and advanced models, organizations with weak practices see worse outcomes because AI doesn't know your context (payment timeouts, schema changes), doesn't enforce discipline (can't make you write tests), and can't fix organizational dysfunction when failures compound. DORA's survey of nearly 5,000 technology professionals shows organizations strong in the seven capabilities see significantly higher productivity gains, with over 80% believing AI increased their productivity.

## Key Concepts

- AI as amplifier: multiplies existing organizational capability—strong practices become better, weak practices create problems faster
- Seven DORA capabilities: Clear AI Stance, Healthy Data Ecosystem, AI-Accessible Data, Strong Version Control, Small Batches, User-Centric Focus, Quality Platform
- Guardrails enable speed: automated tests, code review, CI/CD, and monitoring provide confidence for bold AI-assisted experimentation and risk-taking
- Self-assessment reality check: 5-7 capabilities checked = well-positioned, 3-4 = mixed readiness, 0-2 = AI will amplify existing problems
- Evidence trumps aspiration: DORA survey of 5,000+ professionals shows organizational capability determines AI success more than model sophistication
