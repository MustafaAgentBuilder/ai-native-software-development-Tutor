# Summary

The 90-10 economic model revolutionizes software production: AI automates 90% mechanical work (code execution, workflows, data transformations) while humans provide 10% strategic judgment (what to build, market understanding, prioritization) that becomes infinitely more valuable. Instagram ($1B with 13 employees = $77M per employee) and WhatsApp ($19B with 55 employees = $345M per employee) validated this by delegating infrastructure to focus on strategic decisions. Solo developers can reach $10M annual revenue without proportional team scaling through subagent scaling, customer LTV compounding, and operational leverage. The bottleneck shifts from implementation capacity to strategic attention.

## Key Concepts

- 90-10 rule: AI handles mechanical 90%, humans provide strategic 10% that grows infinitely valuable
- Historical precedent: Instagram $77M, WhatsApp $345M value-per-employee through infrastructure delegation
- Solo to $10M pathway: subagent scaling + customer LTV + operational leverage without team growth
- Competitive advantage shifts from coding speed to strategic insight and domain knowledge
- Bottleneck is human attention on strategic decisions, not infrastructure capacity
