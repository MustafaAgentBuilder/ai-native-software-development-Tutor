# Summary

The Snakes and Ladders framework maps AI software markets as four competitive layers, where billion-dollar success comes from dominating one layer rather than competing across all four. Layer 1 (Consumer AI) is the "snake" to avoid—OpenAI and Google's capital-intensive two-player war. Layer 2 (Developer Tools) is the first ladder where Claude Code achieved $500M ARR in two months through specialization. Layer 3 (Vertical Markets) offers $100M+ opportunities by solving industry-specific problems faster than incumbents bound by legacy systems. Layer 4 (Orchestration) coordinates all subagents but requires first dominating lower layers.

## Key Concepts

- Four layers: Consumer AI (avoid), Developer Tools (specialize), Vertical Markets (dominate), Orchestration (integrate upward)
- Specialization beats general-purpose—creates defensibility and faster adoption
- Incumbents' inertia creates competitive advantage for agile solo developers
- Historical lesson: Microsoft's Windows Mobile failed competing at wrong layer
- Start at Layer 2/3, dominate one layer, then integrate upward to Layer 4
